# zephyr

process of creating an advanced petcare search tool using cutting-edge Zephyr 7B Beta LLM. 
- power and efficiency of BGE Embeddings, an open-source embedding mode that adds depth to our tool. 
- the speed and flexibility of Chroma DB, an in-memory vector store designed for instantaneous data access. 
- the seamless integration made possible with Langchain, hosen orchestration framework.

RAG or Retrieval Augmented Generation helps our search tool, enabling extractive & generative QA capabilities that fetches relevant petcare information and also generate human-like responses to user queries.
